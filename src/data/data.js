It allows moving data from a mobile device to a PC/Mac/Linux or vice versa. The speed is quite impressive: data transfer from a computer is about 130MB/Sec thanks to the USB 3.0 technology. A Dual USB Drive makes it possible to transfer data offline if there’s no cable around. Another feature this item allows is memory increasing. Put the stick into the port and shoot as many photos and videos as you want (unless you got to make 2-hour 4k movies). Great as a backup item in case you’ll need to transfer some data urgently and for those who suffer from smartphone manufacturer’s memory policies.
