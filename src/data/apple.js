The overall construction might seem shaky and unsteady, but as soon you put it on your table you’ll notice that it’s quite stable and not easy to move because of the non-slip pad attached to the bottom. At the same time, the docking station is not heavy enough to take it with while traveling or simply take it sometimes to your office. The assembly process is quite easy, you need literally 10 minutes to set everything up: all you need is already in the box including the docking station itself, screws, screwdriver and a quick manual on how to manage all of that. You just attach your cables and adjust their length – the unneeded extra cable length will be hidden inside the station, so after setting up once there will be no need to deal with all the cable chaos as we usually do. The last thing to do is obviously plugging into the socket or connecting to the laptop. What is the best way to get the Dock Station for iPhone and Apple Watch?

Lower resolution in combination with the new processor power grants a performance boost comparing to bigger models. This display is built under the IPS technology and does not support a 3D-touch feature. Unlike the iPhone XS, the R model has only one camera module with the same sensor and other internal parts. The water protections here is rated on the IP67 level which allows you to dip the phone under the water for 30 minutes and keep it safe from dust. The XR model doesn’t have the physical button beneath the screen which means it supports Face ID technology that has also been improved.
